## Building An Accurate Detector for Masked Faces in the Pandemic Era

#### Summary
Since March, Covid-19 has taken a heavy toll on American societies. As suggested by the health experts and the governments, having everyone in the community wear a mask can help mitigate the risk of asymptomatic people spreading the virus. To improve peopleâ€™s awareness and help businesses monitor the points of entrance and enforce the social distancing policies, society calls for better contactless monitoring and identity verification methods.
In such a situation, corresponding masked face detection algorithms can be designed to help monitor whether people wear masks while in public places, such as markets, groceries, and offices. Furthermore, non-masked face recognition and masked-face recognition could be explored separately. We can also extend non-masked face recognition to more complex environments, and multi-face with the background can be one possible way. Given the limited time and resources, the project may touch 2-3 sections mentioned above.
We will utilize the Real-World Masked Face Dataset from Github, which includes real-world masked faces, faces with simulated masks, and non-masked faces. CNN is considered the most common deep learning method in facial recognition, and we will adopt the idea of transfer learning and begin with a pre-trained CNN model.
